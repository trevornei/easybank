This project is built with:
| React
| Vite
| Tailwindcss

I started this project a while ago while ago and decided to recently come back into it. I remember working on this project in an airport lounge at the international airport in Lima Peru a few years ago. It's fun circling back to this project because I remember implementing useEffect() as the edge of my knowledge. Now it's funny think about a core piece of kit being hard.

About this project:

- Every Front End Mentor projects is based off a professionally made UI/UX design in Figma.
- It is the developers job to recreate the project using their preffered stack.
- To respect Front End Mentors IP, I do not have the design file uploaded to this repository (per request/agreement).
